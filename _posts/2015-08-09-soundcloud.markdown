title:  "SoundCloud should encourage Track ID's on mixes."

It's really frustrating for both music composers and listeners that DJ's are putting mixes on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) without any reference to the original songs.

Don't get me wrong: I love mixes and I admire DJ's for their work. I think mixes are a great way to discover new songs and new artists.

But I also feel that they often get away with all the credit. Composing music is by far more difficult and requires more skill that mixing songs.

I feel that music composers should be mentioned and clearly visible, also if their song is part of a mix. How many times do I see comments on mixes with people shouting: "Track ID please!!!".  
SoundCloud could encourage DJ's putting mixes on their platform that contain references to the underlying songs (by highlighting mixes that do provide track ID's for example).

Wouldn't it be nice so be able to listen to a mix, and see at any moment the current song being played?
