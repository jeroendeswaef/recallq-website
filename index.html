  <h1>Ideas</h1>
  <h3>Raspberry Pi Chess board</h3>
  <img src="chess-1.png" alt="Chess board with camera" />
  <p>The idea is to able to play chess against the computer, using a normal chess board. All different pieces on the board would have to be marked with different colors. This could be done by painting them, or applying a colored dot on top of them. A camera would be placed on top of the board, looking down. Then, the Raspberry Pi would be able to figure out where all the pieces are, using openCV or similar software. The computer makes it move by saying which piece to move to which location. The player would still have to move the pieces by himself.</p>
